#### Deploying an application to OpenShift Cluster  
```bash
oc login -u developer -p developer
oc new-project docker-build

oc new-app --as-deployment-config --name echo https://github.com/$RHT_OCP4_GITHUB_USER/DO288-apps#docker-build --context-dir ubi-echo

oc describe is echo
```  

#### Deploying and Managing Applications on OpenShift Cluster  
1. Navigate to your local clone of the DO288-apps Git repository and create a new branch named source-build from the master branch. Deploy the application (name: `greet`) in the nodejs-helloworld folder to the source-build project on the OpenShift cluster.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO288-apps.git

oc login -u developer -p developer
oc new-project source-build

git checkout master
git checkout -b source-build
git push -u origin source-build

oc new-app --name 
```

#### # Configuring the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
-  Some applications receive a large number of concurrent requests only during certain periods, which makes it very difficult to size the number of pods up front before running the application. However, there are extra costs associated with running more pods than required when traffic is not at its peak.

- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform refers to the action of changing the number of pods for an application as scaling. Scaling up refers to increasing the number of pods for an application. Scaling down refers to decreasing that number. Scaling up allows the application to handle more client requests, and scaling down provides cost savings when the load goes down. 

- When scaling up an application, the OpenShift platform first deploys a new pod and then waits for the pod to be ready. Only after the new pod becomes available does the OpenShift platform configure the route to also send traffic to the new pod. 

- When scaling down, OpenShift reconfigures the route to stop sending traffic to the pod, and then deletes the pod. 

```bash
$ oc autoscale dc/frontend --min=1 --max=5 --cpu-percent=80

The options are as follows:

dc/frontend
    Name of the application deployment configuration resource 

--min=1
    Minimum number of pods 

--max=5
    Maximum number of pods. HPA does not scale up the application beyond this limit, even if the load continues to increase. 

--cpu-percent=80
    Ideal average CPU utilization for each pod. If the global average CPU utilization is above that value, then HPA starts a new pod. If the global average CPU utilization is below the value, then HPA deletes a pod. 
```


## # Creating Containerized Services
### # Provisioning Containerized Services
#### # Managing Containers with Podman
- Podman is an open source tool for managing containers and container images and interacting with image registries. Some of the following key features:
    - It uses image format specified by the Open Container Initiative (OCI). It define an standard, community-driven, non-proprietary image format.
    - It stores local images in local file-system. It avoids unnecessary client/server architecture or having daemons running on local machine.
    - It follows the same command patterns as the Docker CLI, no need to learn a new toolset.
    - Podman compatible with Kubernetes. 

#### # Fetching Container Images with Podman
```bash
$ sudo podman search rhel

```

#### # Running Containers
- Podman command options: 
    - -t or --tty, meaning a pseudo-tty (pseudo-terminal) is to be allocated for the container.
    - -i or --interactive. When used, standard input is kept open into the container.
    - -d or --detach, means the container runs in the background (detached). Podman prints the container id.

```bash
$ sudo podman run rhel:latest echo 'Hello!'
        Hello!

$ sudo podman run -d rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7:2.4-36.5
